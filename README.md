# **Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard**

## **Overview**
This project involves analyzing hospital emergency room data spanning **January 2023 to December 2024**. Using **Power BI**, I built an interactive dashboard to provide actionable insights into patient demographics, wait times, satisfaction levels, admission patterns, and referral trends.

The dataset, provided in CSV format, was cleaned, transformed, and visualized to highlight key metrics and patterns. The final dashboard was designed to assist in optimizing emergency room operations and improving patient care.
